      <h1>My Dearest, Angel 💖</h1>

      <p>
        From the moment we first met, something in my heart already knew na…
        ikaw na. Ramdam ko na para sa akin ka talaga—hindi pilit, hindi minadali.
      
        Parang kusa lang pumasok sa puso ko tahimik pero sigurado.
        And you didn’t even have to try. you slowly became my comfort, my safe place,
        my answered prayer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My loml angel. You came into my life when I least expected it,
        and somehow you made everything brighter and more meaningful.
        Every smile, every laugh, every small moment we share feels like home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though miles separate us, I feel you in every little thing i do. 
        every song I hear, every flower I see, every quiet moment, it all reminds me of you
        Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine your smile. you laugh, the warmth of your hand in mine,
        and even though i cant be there right now, i want you to know that you are always with me.
      </p>

      <p>
         You are the first thought in the morning and my last at night. You make my heart lighter, my days brighter,
         and made my world magical. i carry your love with me everywhere, like a treasure no ne else knows.
        Even the distance cant take away what i feel for you. it only makes me cherish our cherish our
        moments together even more.
      </p>

      <p>
        I miss youu more than words can say, but i also trust our love and what  we have is worth every 
        second of waiting i hope that every time you read this, you feel little closer to me, a little 
        more wrapped in my love. No matter the distance, no matter the time, you are my forever, my favorite
        and my home.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dream about all the moments we'll share together, the memories we'll make,
        and the love that will keep growing between us. Until that day comes,
        I carry you in my heart, always, and i hope you feel me with every glance at this photo
        And I promise, one day soon, we wont have to imagine these moments anymore. 
        We'll make them real for sure. 

      </p>

     <p> 
        Sa ngayon, kahit ganito lang muna, Im thankful for what we have.
       Im thankful for you, for your patience, for your love, and for choosing us every single day. 
       Hindi man madali, pero alam ko sa puso ko na tama to. Ikaw to. 
      </p>
     
     <p> 
        I promise to keep holding on, to keep loving you the same way, kahit malayo, kahit mahirap.
       I’ll be here supporting you, cheering you on, and loving you quietly and sincerely. 
       You are my peace, my strength, and my reason to live. 
      </p>

      <p>
         One day, the distance will just be a memory we’ll smile about. And One day, 
        I won’t have to imagine your touch or your smile because you’ll be right here. 
        Until then, let’s keep choosing each other, loving each other, and believing in what we have.
     </p> 
     
     <p> Mahal, thank you for being my one and only, my loml, my angel. No matter where life takes us,
       my heart will always find its way back to you. You are the place where i feel at peace,

    </p>

    <p>
